discretion of the instructor.

## Grading Guidelines
Submitted work requires Analysis, Evaluation, and Creation of ideas, concepts, and
materials into various deliverables (e.g., see revised Bloom's Taxonomy
(http://www.nwlink.com/~donclark/hrd/bloom.html) and reference below).

The grade of A is for work that involves high-quality achievement in all three Bloom areas.<br>
The grade of B is for work that involves high-quality achievement in at least two Bloom areas, and mediumlevel
achievement in the other.<br>
The grade of C is for work that involves high-quality achievement in at least one Bloom area, and mediumlevel
achievement in the others.<br>
The grade of F is for work that does not meet above criteria.

## Policies
<b>Exam Policy:</b>
Student performance will be accessed through weekly exams. Each exam will cover the material from the previous week. They will last no more than 15 minutes. No makeup exams will be allowed. Your lowest exam grade will be dropped.

<b>Homework Policy and Learn2Mine Coding:</b>
Homework will be assigned each week and collected before the weekly exam. Homework will be graded pass or fail and are designed to help you study for the exams. For the majority of the classes, the worksheets will double as assigned homework for you to turn in before the following exam.

Regular theory focused programming assignments will be submitted through the Learn2Mine environment. You will use Python to complete the assignments. Usernames and passwords will be supplied, but you may install your own software as well on your local computer, but installation problems will not be supported.

<b>Programming Projects</b>
Programming projects will be submitted through OAKS in the form of a write-up. For these projects, you may work with a partner, but you must submit your own write-up in the following format:

<b>
Your write-up must have the following headings and you must answer the following:<br/>
a.)	What were the steps you carried out to arrive at your answer? i.e., describe your process.
<br/>
b.)	Please provide documentation of the correctness of your answer (screenshots, code examples, etc).
<br/>
c.)	Are there any portions of your answer that are not completed, wrong, or otherwise a problem?
</b>

<b>Honor Code: </b>
You must do your work alone (or with your teammates, for group assignments).<br>
You must identify your sources of material and inspiration. It is a violation of the honor code to present
someone else's work or ideas as your own.<br>
In any course deliverable, you must always identify the person(s) that helped you (directly or indirectly), if
any, and explain their contribution to your work.<br>
Also see the College of Charleston Student Handbook, especially sections on The Honor Code (p. 11), and
Student Code of Conduct (p. 12). There is other useful information there.

<b>Classroom Policies: </b>
* The beginning of the class will be devoted to introducing new material. It has been shown in numerous studies that even having a laptop open during this type of instruction negatively affects not only your learning but those around you. Because of this, I recommend you put your laptop away for this portion. I will do my best to record all lectures and post them in a timely fashion (sorry. the room we are in doesn't support this).<br>
* You are expected to take good notes during class.
* You are expected to participate in class with questions and invited discussion.
* You are expected to attend all classes. The grade 'WA' will be given for excessive (>= 3) absences. If you
miss class, you must get an absence memo from the Associate Dean of Students Office
(http://studentaffairs.cofc.edu/general_info/absence/) ; also, you are responsible for announcements made in
class, assignment due dates, etc.
* In summary, you should contribute positively to the classroom learning experience, and respect your
classmates right to learn (see College of Charleston Student Handbook (http://studentaffairs.cofc.edu/honorsystem/
studenthandbook/index.php) , section on Classroom Code of Conduct (p. 58)).

<b>Late Policy: </b>
No late days will be allowed without an excuse. This course is an upper level course, and it will move very fast.
Falling behind on assignments will make it difficult to achieve the learning outcomes of this course.

<b>Final Exam: </b>
No final exam.

<b>Facebook Group: </b>
Everyone must join the Facebook group for class discussions: 
<a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/1632204273751877/">https://www.facebook.com/groups/1632204273751877/</a>. If you do not join, you might miss important announcements and discussions.

# Schedule
You are responsible for coming prepared to class. This includes reading through the material before attending class.
You will get a lot more out of the lectures and discussions in this manner. It is cliche, but true. Each week will follow a similar pattern. The course focuses both on the theory of data mining, maching learning, and its practical application. Most classes will start with an exam over the previous week's material. followed by a lecture on new material. Followed by an interactive exercise focusing on the theory. Follwed by an interactive lecture/exercise focusing on the application. This will sometimes be guided. sometimes in groups, and sometimes individually. The schedule below is tentative and subject to change. You must check it regularly. 

<b>Week 1:</b><br/>
No class as we meet on Monday and the semester hasn't started yet.

<b>Week 2:</b><br/>

Introduction to Programming Assignments and our first one!
<br>

1. Get username and password to online environment. You can also download and run locally, but you are on your own if you do that. Some suggestions if you go that route: https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-best-Python-IDE-for-doing-data-analysis-science-and-ML-on-Macs

2. Join Learn2Mine Class

3. Complete the online introductory assignments on Learn2Mine

4. Complete the following programming assignment. 

<hr>
## Programming Assignment 1
Using the naive Bayesian classifier in scikit learn, train a model on Titanic dataset that we used on Learn2Mine and is available on Kaggle. Try at least three different types of models by varying parameters and methods. Report both your internal training accuracy and the test set accuracy calculated by Kaggle. Also, please generate a ROC curve and calculate the area under the curve for at least one of your models. 

Here is a link to get you started: http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/naive_bayes.html. But these programming assignments are not recipe driven on purpose. They are for you to experiment with publically available packages and apply them. You can work with your partner, but you must submit your own report to OAKS. It MUST follow the format specified in the syllabus, or I will return it without grading for you to fix.

<b>Week 8:</b><br/>
Exam over Chapter 4 and the previous worksheet (due at start of class).

<hr>
## Programming Assignment 2
Using the MLPClassifier, analyze the MNIST dataset (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/). Here is some good starter code (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/neural_networks/plot_mnist_filters.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-neural-networks-plot-mnist-filters-py). The MNIST link has a bunch of ideas about the architectures of the neural networks that work well (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).  Try at least 5 different architectures and parameters. Generate a ROC(s) curve using cross-validation (http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/model_selection/plot_roc_crossval.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-model-selection-plot-roc-crossval-py). Summarize the AUCs of your different models and synthesize your overall results. You can use leave-one-out or k-fold cross-validation. How do your results compare to the best available results for the MNIST data?

Now that you've got experience with the MNIST dataset, answer the following questions: What is the baseline accuracy for this dataset? i.e., what if you just guessed the label with the maximum number of samples? What architecture seemed to work the best? How many training iterations did it require?

Remember, these programming assignments are not recipe driven on purpose. They are for you to experiment with publically available packages and apply them. You can work with your partner, but you must submit your own report to OAKS. It MUST follow the format specified in the syllabus, or I will return it without grading for you to fix.
